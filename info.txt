What is the DOM?

Problems with the DOM
  - It changes
  - Changing it is slow

What is EDN?

What is AJAX?

How to build a web framework:
   - Should do things the Clojure Way
   - Code should be in the functional style
   - The browser DOM should be EDN data stored in an atom

DOM is not a complete representation of browser state
   - Can't set button as pushed
   - Can't set scrollbar position
   - Can't set text selection

Problem: AJAX requires side effects. Reframed problem: Our state atom no longer contains the whole world
   
Original sin: Our state is _always_ corrupt in a program that uses AJAX.

We have to contain the corruption (Can be done with FP)
We have to repair the corruption (Requires imperative programming)

"State Corruption" Design Pattern

AJAX=Corruption of state

Corruption is implicit- Make it explicit

GET: State item has value of nil
     or selection variable has id that points to nonexistent item

POST: Create new item in state with id=nil

PUT: Have "holding area" in state, set source of truth=nil. Move from holding area back to final area 

DELETE: Just delete item

*todos
item insert/deletion in delta system
text selection
full IK artwork
"preview" in calculator

*Hello World
(ns my-app.core
    (:use [webfui.framework :only [launch-app]]))

(defn render-all []
      "hello world!")

(launch-app (atom nil) render-all)



*timing
~250 for mouseup
~150 for webfui code
~90 for parsing html
~90 for delta detection
